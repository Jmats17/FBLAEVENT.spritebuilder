FBLA_MobileApp_Competition
==========================

Our competition for FBLA which is a mobile app for school events

Our task was to create a calender to show all of the school events dating from the first day, into the next few 
months. We created this simple, yet easy to use calender with predetermined events for school that is simple, looks good, and works flawlessly. 

FOR JUDGES:

ALSO TO KNOW, in the app, when it loads, there are mini calenders that act as buttons, click one to go to that selected month, in the month you can click a day for selected event

Steps

1. Make sure you have latest version of Xcode and Spritebuilder

2. Download the file from https://github.com/Jmats17/FBLAEVENT.spritebuilder or in the Dropbox that it was sent to. (Prefer Github as dropbox may not work correctly)

3. Open spritebuilder, go to file --> open --> the .ccbproj ---> publish at the top of the program 

4. Open Xcode --> click the simulator at the top --> PICK iPhone 6 or iPhone 4s --> build and wait for it to load

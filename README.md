FBLA_MobileApp_Competition
==========================

Our competition for FBLA which is a mobile app for school events

Our task was to create a calender to show all of the school events dating from the first day, into the next few 
months. We created this simple, yet easy to use calender with predetermined events for school that is simple, looks good, and works flawlessly.
